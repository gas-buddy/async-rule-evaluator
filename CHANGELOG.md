1.0.0
=====
* Everything changes.

1.1.0
=====
* Modify function calls to include the property resolver, fix the cache of resolutions to be run-specific not filter-specific

1.2.0
=====
* Add length function that returns a length property if present, or 0 if not (or if length property is falsy). Note that this means custom non-numeric length property will make it through
